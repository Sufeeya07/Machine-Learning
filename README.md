# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a type of technology that helps computers learn from data and make decisions without being directly programmed. Instead of following fixed instructions, ML models improve over time by recognizing patterns in data.

## Types of Machine Learning
1️⃣ Supervised Learning – The model learns from labeled data (e.g., spam detection, price prediction).
2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning – The model finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection).
3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning – The model learns by trial and error to maximize rewards (e.g., game playing, robotics).

## Common ML Algorithms
🔹 Linear Regression – Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices)
🔹 Logistic Regression – Used for binary classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam)
🔹 Decision Trees – Splits data into branches for decision-making
🔹 Random Forest – An ensemble of multiple decision trees
🔹 Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Finds the best boundary between classes
🔹 Neural Networks – Used in deep learning for complex patterns

## Applications of ML
✅ Healthcare – Disease prediction, medical imaging analysis
✅ Finance – Fraud detection, stock market predictions
✅ Retail – Recommendation systems, demand forecasting
✅ Self-driving Cars – Object detection, path planning
✅ Chatbots & AI Assistants – Natural language processing (NLP)
